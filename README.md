Find Your Stay is a full-stack web application designed to help users explore, rent, and manage accommodation listings seamlessly. It works like a mini Airbnb, where users can browse available stays, view detailed property pages, read reviews, add listings, and create accounts to manage their own properties.

The application is built with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and EJS, following the MVC architecture. It also features secure authentication with Passport.js, session storage using MongoDB, and flash-based notifications for smooth user interaction.

The main focus of this project is to create a real-world property rental platform with features like:

-> User authentication & authorization

-> Adding, editing, and deleting property listings

-> Review & rating system

-> Session handling using MongoStore

-> Admin access & dashboard

-> Full CRUD operations

-> Clean UI with dynamic EJS templates
